          <div class="date">25 MAY 2016</div>
          <p class="card-text text-center font-italic">After weeks of peruasion, my brother Nick convinced me to 
            start a NFT project. The original idea was to make a game 
            just to learn about NFT's for myself and being a Computer Science masters student
            with a specialization in Data Science, I thought it would be fun to play around with 
            NFT data and pass the data into some Machine Learning 
            models I was learning in class.  
          </p> 
          <p class="card-text text-center font-italic">...But step one, i needed art. So I decided to draw it myself.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">Research</h4>
        <p class="card-text text-center font-italic">
          I had to complete alot of reasearch from how to create 
          smart contracts to write to the blockchain, how to 
          use programs that would mix and max image layers to 
          generate unique images for the nft's. This date 
          marks the completion of the first kraken make on the 
          computer. 
        </p> 
        <p class="card-text text-center font-italic">
         While this was going to be a personal project, research showed 
         me that gas, minting, fees and other expenses are very volitile. 
         I also learned that the coolest part of NFT's are the community 
         that surrounds them, so after some thought i decided that 
         this project might need outside funding for expenses and to 
         drive awarness to the project.
